Description: Hayai-Annotation Plants is an R-package with a shiny-based interface for an ultra-fast and accurate gene annotation system for plant species using R. The pipeline combines the sequence-similarity searches, using USEARCH against UniProtKB (taxonomy Viridiplantae), with a functional annotation step. Hayai-Annotation Plants provides six layers of annotation: 1) Protein name; 2) Gene name; 3) Gene Ontology ID and Terms, consisting of its three main domains (Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component); 4) Enzyme Commission number; 5) Protein Existence level; 6) and Evidence type for GO annotation.
