#Description: Hayai-Annotation Plants is an R-package with a shiny-based interface for an ultra-fast and accurate gene annotation system for plant species using R. The pipeline combines the sequence-similarity searches, using USEARCH against UniProtKB (taxonomy Embryophyta), with a functional annotation step. Hayai-Annotation Plants provides five layers of annotation: 1) gene name; 2) gene ontology terms consisting of its three main domains (Biological Process, Molecular Function, and Cellular Component); 3) enzyme commission number; 4) protein existence level; 5) and evidence type.
